Download OBDSim:

wget http://icculus.org/obdgpslogger/downloads/obdgpslogger-0.16.tar.gz 

Or get the most recent version from: http://icculus.org/obdgpslogger/

Install OBDSim:

tar -zxvf obdgpslogger-0.16.tar.gz
cd obdgpslogger-0.16
mkdir build
cd build

I have to install only these libraries, but in your case keep attention to warning messages of cmake and install all that it ask you to install:

sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev libfltk1.1-dev libfltk1.1 fltk1.1-doc fluid fftw3-dev libgps-dev libftdi-dev
cmake .. 
make obdsim
cd ../bin/

Run OBDSim:

./obdsim -b -g gui_fltk

Now you have OBDSim running, but you need a channel to communicate it with your app. You need a serial port working as a bluetooth interface.

Creating the serial->bluetooth interface:

sudo rfcomm bind 0 00:00:00:00:00:00 1 # Change this MAC address, putting the MAC of your device
sudo sdptool add SP

You can discover the MAC address of your device by using hcitool:

hcitool dev
