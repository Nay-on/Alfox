OBDII/GPS Logging Tool


What?

Your car has lots of interesting things it can tell you from the
on-board computer while it's running. obdgpslogger is a small tool
to grab data from an OBDII device and log it to an sqlite database.
If you enable it [on by default, and a large part of this project's
point], then your gps position is also logged to the same database.


What are the other requirements?

Install gpsd first if you want gps support.
The GUI component requires FLTK and fluid.


How do I build this?

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. # or ccmake .. to edit options
make
make install


And how do I run it?

obdgui # GUI for launching and getting live feedback from other tools
obdgpslogger [-s serialport] [-d sqlite database] # Actual logger
obd2kml [-d sqlite database] [-o output file] # Convert to Google Earth
