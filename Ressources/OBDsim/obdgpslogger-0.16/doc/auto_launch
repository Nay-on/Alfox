There's a couple different things in obdgpslogger to make it easy to
use in an auto-launch-when-you-plug-it-in kind of way:


0) If you're going to have your gps and OBDII devices both plugged in
when you boot, you need to implement some kind of delay

That's what udev_delay.sh in this dir does. Read it, instead


1) Modify the config file /etc/obdgpslogger to point the logfile where
you'd like to save it, probably on removable media. eg

log_file=/media/usbthumb/carlog.db

If you have an OBDLink or other device that defaults to 38400 baud
instead of 9600, then add this line to that file, also:

baudrate=38400


2a) If your system has the ftdi kernel module [ie, regular Linux boxes]

Add a rule to launch obdgpslogger: /etc/udev/rules.d/40-ftdi.rules

SUBSYSTEM!="tty", GOTO="ftdi_rules_end"
ACTION=="add", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0403", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6001", RUN+="/usr/local/bin/obdgpslogger -ms /dev/%k"
LABEL="ftdi_rules_end"


2b) If your system does not have the ftdi kernel module [eg, older
SheevaPlugs or Ubunu 9.10 with buggy ftdi_sio]

Create a shell script in /usr/local/bin called "obd_ftdilaunch.sh":

#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/obdftdipty -cdb 38400
# If your device defaults to 9600 baud, just use "-cd"
exec /usr/local/bin/obdgpslogger

Add a rule to launch obdgpslogger: /etc/udev/rules.d/40-ftdi.rules

ACTION=="add", BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0403", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6001", RUN+="/usr/local/bin/obd_ftdilaunch.sh"
